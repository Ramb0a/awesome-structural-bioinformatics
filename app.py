Most code written in Python :dragon:  except when it isn't. 

Want a better way to learn? Spend 4-12 years of your life and hundreds of thousands of dollars chasing a paper with a stamp on it :medal:

Or feed yourself :baby_bottle:

## Why This Book

Most books on Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, Quantum Chemistry, are good for inducing sleep ðŸ˜´ and  fleecing your wallet :moneybag: 

Knoweldge should be cheap, fast enjoyable, silly, shared, disproven, contested, fun and most of all free. This book combats knowledge hodlers, and innovation stifflers by not being boring and old. 

Though we look at  supposedly outdated (if you can't date yourself, who can you date?) Machine Learning methods as applied to Molecular Informatics, this is for the young of mind and young of spirit ðŸš¼
