# Learning Molecular Informatics Artifically Deep

An artificially deep look at ML for Molecular Informatics. Only what is necessary to do cool $h1t.

Most code written in Python üêç and Juptyer Notebooks üìì except when it isn't. Deal with it. 

Want a better way to learn? Spend 4-12 years of your life and hundreds of thousands of dollars chasing a paper with a stamp on it ü•á.

Or feed yourself üçº. No one cares which choice you make.

## Why This Book

Books on Cheminformatics, Bioinformatics, Quantum Chemistry strangle the subject to sleep üò¥ and command a wild price ü§ë for the naps they induce. 

Knoweldge should be cheap, fast enjoyable, silly, shared, disproven, contested, and most of all free. This book combats knowledge hodlers, and innovation stifflers by not being boring and old. Though we look at all the supposedly outdated Machine Learning methods applied to Molecular Informatics (if you can't date yourself, who can you date?) , this is for the young of mind and young of spirit üöº.

## Scoring Function 

 there are two common approaches to building a score function: 
* **potentials of mean force**
    * often called statistics- or Boltzmann-based force fields
    * measuring distance as a reflection of statistical tendencies within proteins
    * . One takes a large set of proteins, collects statistics and converts them to a score function. One then expects this function to work well for proteins not included in its parameterisation. 
* **an optimization calculation**
   * select underlying basis function 
      * quasi-Lennard-Jones 
      * various sigmoidal functions 
   * We can say that the correct structure is whatever is given in the protein data bank, but unfortunately, there is almost an infinity of incorrect structures for a sequence and one would like the score function to penalize all of them
  *  One way to encode this idea is to adopt a statistical approach and try to consider the distribution of incorrect structures

Allowing gaps and insertions at any position and of any length leads to a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. The calculation can be made tractable by restricting the search space and forbidding gaps except in recognised loops in template structures.

There is a score function and a fast method for producing the best possible sequence to structure alignments and thus the best models possible. Unfortunately, the problem is still not solved
